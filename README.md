# Cat-Dog Classifier

- For building this application Flutter toolkit is used.

- I have used Dataseb available on kaggle for creating model on Teachable Machine.

- The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or cat.

- Although the problem sounds simple, it was only effectively addressed in the last few years using deep learning convolutional neural networks.

- Application allows user to take photo or choose image from gallery.
